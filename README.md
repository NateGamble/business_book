# Business Book

API created for project 2 at Revature

Business Book is a full stack web application utilizing a custom API to provide businesses the ability to post updates to the users of the app in real time on a map supplied by Google Maps API. Users that have registered with the application can see the businesses near them and their posts / updates, review those businesses, and set their favorite businesses. Business owners will be able to add their business to the application map, add posts / updates, and edit their business details. Admins have the capability to modify User and Business Accounts.
